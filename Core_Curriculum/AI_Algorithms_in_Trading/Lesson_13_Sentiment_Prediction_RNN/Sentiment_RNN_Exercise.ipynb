    "# Sentiment Analysis with an RNN\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll implement a recurrent neural network that performs sentiment analysis. \n",
    ">Using an RNN rather than a strictly feedforward network is more accurate since we can include information about the *sequence* of words. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll use a dataset of movie reviews, accompanied by sentiment labels: positive or negative.\n",

    "\n",
    "The architecture for this network is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/network_diagram.png\" width=40%>\n",
    "\n",
    ">**First, we'll pass in words to an embedding layer.** We need an embedding layer because we have tens of thousands of words, so we'll need a more efficient representation for our input data than one-hot encoded vectors. You should have seen this before from the Word2Vec lesson. You can actually train an embedding with the Skip-gram Word2Vec model and use those embeddings as input, here. However, it's good enough to just have an embedding layer and let the network learn a different embedding table on its own. *In this case, the embedding layer is for dimensionality reduction, rather than for learning semantic representations.*\n",
    "\n",
    ">**After input words are passed to an embedding layer, the new embeddings will be passed to LSTM cells.** The LSTM cells will add *recurrent* connections to the network and give us the ability to include information about the *sequence* of words in the movie review data. \n",
    "\n",
    ">**Finally, the LSTM outputs will go to a sigmoid output layer.** We're using a sigmoid function because positive and negative = 1 and 0, respectively, and a sigmoid will output predicted, sentiment values between 0-1. \n",
    "\n",
    "We don't care about the sigmoid outputs except for the **very last one**; we can ignore the rest. We'll calculate the loss by comparing the output at the last time step and the training label (pos or neg)."

It is massively inefficient to one-hot encode that many classes. So, instead of one-hot encoding, we can have an embedding layer and use that layer as a lookup table. You could train an embedding layer using Word2Vec, then load it here. But, it's fine to just make a new layer, using it for only dimensionality reduction, and let the network learn the weights.\n",

    "tesla = 'Tesla’s stock shoots up toward another record after Wedbush analyst boosts target to 4th highest on the Street. Wedbush’s Dan Ives’s new target represents a 15% rally off last close, but he still doesn’t recommend investors buy the stock. Shares of Tesla Inc. rose Monday toward a second straight record, after Wedbush analyst Dan Ives raised his target to be the fourth-highest on Wall Street, citing signs of accelerating demand in China. But while his target represents a 15% rally above Friday’s record close of $1,650.71, Ives still doesn’t recommend investors buy the stock. Tesla shares climbed 8.3% in afternoon trading, adding to the 20.1% surge over the previous three sessions, in the wake of the electric vehicle maker’s announcement of a 5-for-1 stock split. Ives raised his price target to $1,900 from $1,800. Of the 35 analysts surveyed by FactSet, Ives’s target is now only below the $2,400 target of Piper Sandler’s Alexander Potter, Oppenheimer’s Colin Rusch’s target of $2,209 and the $1,903.97 target of Everbright Securities’ Yu Jing Ni. Ives’s “base case” target is well above the average target of $1,235.37, which is 25.2% below Friday’s closing price. Meanwhile, Ives’s “bull case” target is $2,500. Meanwhile, he reiterated the neutral rating he’s had on the stock since April 25, 2019. At that time, his price target was $275. “We continue to believe [electric vehicle] demand in China is starting to accelerate in July/August with Tesla competing with a number of domestic and international competitors for market share with Giga 3 remaining the linchpin of success which remains the prize that [Chief Executive Elon] Musk and Tesla are laser focused on capturing,” Ives wrote in a research note. “We are seeing more leverage in the story now on the horizon out of Giga 3 along with some price cuts both in the US and China that could further stimulate demand as the macro starts to improve and the lockdown conditions ease globally,” Ives wrote. He expects Tesla to announce a number of new potential “game changing” battery developments at the company’s Battery Day event, scheduled for Sept. 22, including a “million mile” battery. “In theory, this battery will support an electric vehicle for 1 million miles and be a major step forward when competing versus. traditional gasoline powered automotive competitors from both a [return on investment] and environmental perspective,” Ives wrote. Tesla’s stock has more than doubled (up 123.6%) over the past three months, while shares of China-based rival Nio Inc. NIO, 6.30% have skyrocketed fourfold (up 311.6%) the S&P 500 index SPX, 0.31% has climbed 18.2%. Over the same time, Ives’s price target has more than tripled, as his price target as of May 17 was $600. Meanwhile, General Motors Co.’s stock GM, 7.65% jumped 8.0% toward a two-month high, after Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner pushed for the automaker to spin off its EV business into a separate entity. Rosner, who rates GM a buy, said he was adding the stock to Deutsche Bank’s short-term Catalyst Call Buy List. Rosner said he believes an EV spinoff would force the market to recognize its EV technology and upcoming vehicle lineup, “unlock considerable shareholder value,” give the new entity access to cheap capital and provide the new entity with the ability to attract high-caliber talent. GM’s stock has gained 322.9% over the past three months, but has dropped 17.8% year to date, while Tesla’s stock has skyrocketed more than fourfold (up 327.2%) this year.'"

    "tesla2 = 'Tesla Gigafactory Texas moves at lightning speed with pile drivers already on site. Tesla Gigafactory Texas is moving at lightning speed with pile drivers already on-site – meaning that the foundations are coming soon. After Tesla finally confirmed a site next to Austin for its next gigafactory in the US last month, the automaker started moving quickly to build the factory. A contractor quickly took over the site and started ground preparation to clear a massive space to start construction at the 2,000-acre piece of land. Up to now, it was still mainly just moving dirt, but Tesla has now brought a few pile drivers at the site, which means that it is getting ready to start building the foundations for the first few buildings: A pile driver is a device used to drive piles into soil to provide foundation support for buildings. As per the last drone flyover last weekend, we can see 4 of them already on-site – hinting at Tesla starting to work on foundations soon: As shown in the video, it looks like Tesla is planning to first build a long building at the site: Tesla has not shared a clear timeline for when the construction of the new factory will be completed, but we’ve got a good idea of it thanks to the vehicle programs Tesla plans to produce at Gigafactory Texas. The automaker wants to produce the Cybertruck and Tesla Semi electric trucks at the location by the end of next year. Tesla is also planning to produce Model Y and Model 3 vehicles at the factory, and we’ve heard that the automaker plans on deploying some level of Model Y production at the plant first. Last week, Jerome Guillen, Tesla President of Automotive, said that Tesla Gigafactory Texas is ‘happening full speed’ and they opened several jobs for the project. '"

    "tesla3 = 'Why Tesla Stock Jumped on Monday. Tesla\\'s deliveries could rise 36% this year, despite a pandemic and temporary pauses in production. Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) were up sharply on Monday. As of 10:30 a.m. EDT, the stock was up 5.5%. The growth stock's sharp move higher is likely driven by an analyst's decision to boost his 12-month price target for shares to $1,900. Shares of Tesla could rise to $1,900 within 12 months, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note on Monday. This view is up from his previous 12-month price target of $1,800. To support his more bullish outlook for the stock, Ives said he believes demand for electric vehicles in China is accelerating in recent months. Tesla, of course, is well positioned to take share in the market following the late-2019 launch of a factory in Shanghai, where the company produces a China-made Model 3 specifically for customers in China. The new Gigafactory is Tesla\\'s \"linchpin of success\" in the market, according to Ives. In addition, recent price cuts could help boost demand for Tesla vehicles in the U.S. and Europe, Ives believes. Importantly, Ives asserts that Tesla seems back on track with its pre-coronavirus full-year delivery target of 500,000 vehicles, despite significant detours earlier this year with factory shutdowns due to the pandemic. That 500,000-vehicle total in 2020 would translate to 36% year-over-year growth. '"
